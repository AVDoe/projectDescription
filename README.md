# Animal Ville rules

1.	All animals have to eat once a day at least
2.	All animals have hunger, happiness and health meters. Any of those fall to 0, animal dies
3.	Hunger - each pet needs to be fed at least once a day
4.	Happiness - play with the animal at least once a day
5.	Wellbeing - clean after the animal
6.	All of the above can be bought - either smart contract or hire people to do it. Hiring people is cheaper - minimum fee set, but people bid
7.	Each species have their own master species characters - 3 females and 3 males. If they die, they go to auction that lasts 24h and the biggest bidder wins the pet.

9.	New pet can be bred. You need to put a male and female example of the same species together for 3 days at first - it goes up additional day for each more than 10.000 of the same species in the world
10.	New pet is randomly assigned to one of the owners of male and female breeder
11.	Master species always spawn with 24h bid auction, even the first ones
12.	ecosystem is run by Animalville coin (AVC)
13.	AVC is minted each time a transaction is made in ecosystem - feeding, petting, cleaning
14.	AVC is burned when used - in auctions, buying food, buying perks â€¦
15.	Actions can be done by others too - in that case, owner of the pet receives 10% of AVC minted and the one doing the above action receives 90% of AVC minted
16.	Above action can be blocked by owner - except for master species characters
17.	Food costs 70% of AVC minted per day
18.	Auctions of master species characters are in AVC
19.	Pets cam get perks - bought in AVC
20.	Perks can be done by anyone - creator receives 95% of initial fees
21.	the bigger the amount of health, happiness and wellbeing restores, more AVC they receive
22.	100 health gives 1 AVC, 100 wellbeing gives 1 AVC, 100 hunger gives 8 AVC
23.	food costs 7AVC - it can be paid on credit so that you do not need AVC to buy food and feed the pet - you only get 1AVC for feeding the pet in that case!
